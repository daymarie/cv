            <h3>Develop your Skill Sets</h3>
          </a>
          <p><em><strong>"When you feel that</strong> - what you're really happy about is a <strong><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FIQZyF_LDLDmoPP7AgycWdoD0tqQ0KvA/view?usp=sharing">
                  particular thing that you do</a></strong>."</em></p>
          <p>Then maybe you can boost that and make something out of it! <strong>Develop your Skill Sets!</strong> </p>
          <p>Sometimes, you get so influenced by what looks good based with other people's judgement, what others have to say about you before you do something for a living, a work, or a job to apply with. I would advise that you <strong>do it for
              your couple of reasons as to Why are you doing it in the first
              place? Why do you want to do it? Do you really want to do it? Think about it, it's not for them, it's for you</strong>. </p>

        </td>
      </tr>
    </table cellspacing="20">

        </div>
  </div>

<div class="middle-container ">

  <p>So what? if the work you want isn't something that is looking good for others?
    Will their judgement be something that will bring your needs or food into your table? Will listening to them be a benefit to you than losing self belief?
    If you look into all that this way, at the end of the day you can determine if you <strong>WILL</strong> really stick to the type of job or work you want to do.</p>
  <p>Like for example you saw a kid vending fish around, assuming you ask yourself - why is the kid selling when they're supposed to be taken care of at home? Is that kid not shy of selling fish in the neighborhood too, just to earn money for
    food? Think about it!</p>
  <p>Even kids are shy about what other people have to say about them. If crushes pass by, what will they say about them?(you know kids now a days) How do people look in their eyes? What are they called of what they're doing? A lot more you can think
    about... but why would a kid do that?.... That's more probably an example of how others may see you, question you and judge you for what you're trying to work with.</p>
  <p>Having experienced the situation above,...</p>
  <p>Selling fish in the neighborhood that my step-father caught from the seashore in our province‚Ä¶</p>
  <p>Selling fish in the neighborhood to earn money so we can buy rice‚Ä¶</p>
  <p>Selling fish in the neighborhood to earn money so I can buy something I want to buy‚Ä¶</p>
  <p>With all other reasons to add why am I selling fish as a kid, one thing is that -</p>
  <p> <strong>Selling</strong> is a <strong>SKILL</strong> that is trully developed through <strong>EXPERIENCE</strong>. I don't know that when I was a kid, all I know is that I have to sell fish because I get something out of it and I need to do it
    for couple of reasons.</p>
  <p>A <strong>beginner?</strong> no problem, everybody starts from the beginning. Settle with yourself as you pick the work you want to do, you work on how you can do it, you will gain more skills along the way.</p>

  <p>Going back to that example: I can say selling made me <strong>DEVELOP</strong> a lot of things already from a young age,
    from selling girly fashion hairstyle items with my classmates, to delicacies, to peanuts, etc.
    when I was still young. From the couple of reasons why I sell to earn, even if I have the option not to, I developed:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The <strong>MORAL VALUES</strong>, the values of doing small things that help us through hunger -
      only, if <strong>I WILL TRY TO HELP, TO BE A PART OF IT</strong>.</li>
    <li>The importance of <strong>DOING MY PART TO ACHIEVE A GOAL</strong>,
      and be able to be a part of <strong>MAKING SOLUTIONS</strong>, because who else will do it if I don‚Äôt try?</li>
    <li>The <strong>PERSEVERANCE</strong> and the <strong>HARD WORK</strong> to sell out as many as I can because the more I do, the more I add into the table.</li>
    <li>The strive to be <strong>EFFICIENT</strong> in what I do that each and every time I could relate to any other things I want, and learn more to be better as well.</li>
    <li>I learn how to <strong>UNLEARN</strong> and <strong>RELEARN</strong> anything that is needed to make it and be the best in what I do.</li>
    <li>Of all, it‚Äôs my <strong>PERSONALITY</strong>‚Ä¶..it gets into my <strong>LIFE CORE VALUES</strong>, up to now a days.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>So <strong>"Selling"</strong> for example as a source of living‚Ä¶ I should say at a very young age - it made me <strong>LOVE</strong> what I do starting from the reason that I have to do it, to molding me to be better of it, that it gave me
    <strong>SKILL SETS</strong> that I realized is something more for me that,
  </p>
  <p>At a very young age, selling cultivated my <strong>SKILLS</strong> in <strong>communications</strong>, <strong>public relations</strong>, <strong>arts to design things and highlight values</strong>, <strong>like how can I show you that
      this item is something you may need or want</strong> - <strong>my way of thinking and strategizing</strong>,
    <strong>how to manage all that I am into</strong>, <strong>how to lead and bump up myself as well when things don't go my way</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>As a Beginner, what ever you're into it is given that <strong>Developing a Skill Set</strong> does not happen in a glimpse, a day or two, it takes first to <strong>have a WILL</strong> to get into a skill you want to develop. <strong>Finding
      your reasons Why Will you do it?</strong> Have a
    <strong>PLAN</strong> and set a <strong>GOAL</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>I <strong>INVEST TIME</strong> and <strong>EFFORT</strong> from a young age, that up to now I even level up <strong>how to find my own way to develop a type of skill I need, by learning from different SOURCES, from the experienced, and
      diving into it myself</strong>, that I take <strong>ACTION</strong> to it, from <strong>basic to mastering</strong> it.</p>
  <p>It made me <strong>HAPPY</strong> remembering the days, that my <strong>SKILL SETS</strong> never stopped me still from selling anything that I am into even up to now a days, could be physical products, digital products, my services. I am
    selling it!</p>
  <p>You probably have the idea now, of how you can develop your skill sets from my Selling experience as an example. <strong>Now think about what makes you happy from what you do as of the moment</strong>, maybe something you do at work, a
    hobby, a dream to be that you love to do, or wish you will be in the future, something you see you can still apply in the future for a long term goal. It can be for a work or job, or for your own business. </p>
  <p><strong>Then see to it that you‚Äôre spending your time starting working for your skills development starting today!</strong> And <strong>COMMIT to it</strong> for yourself! Again you're doing all these for yourself, and not for any other people
    who's taking away any of your self confidence.</p>
